# Deploying

Deploying your applications efficiently and securely is crucial for the smooth
operation of your business processes. We provide a guide to integrate the Volur
SDK into an Azure Function, though there are lots of other options for
deployment.

## Deploying the Volur SDK with Azure Functions

To integrate the Volur SDK into your Azure Function, we provide a comprehensive
guide and example in our SDK repository. This resource includes step-by-step
instructions for setting up your environment, configuring the function, and
deploying it to handle real-world tasks.

For a detailed walkthrough, please visit the [Azure Function Deployment Guide](https://github.com/volur-ai/python-volur-ai-sdk/blob/main/examples/azure-function/README.md) in our SDK repository. This guide covers everything
from initial setup to advanced configuration options, ensuring you have all the
information needed to successfully deploy your Azure Function with the Volur
SDK.
